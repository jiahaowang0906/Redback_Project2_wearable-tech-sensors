Project Goals:

The main objective of this project is to monitor and analyze hydration data collected from a ThingSpeak channel. The data is fetched at regular intervals, stored in a MongoDB database, and then analyzed for insights into hydration levels over time. Key goals include real-time data collection, persistent storage, and data analysis to gain meaningful insights into hydration patterns.
File Inventory:
•	main.py:

	Purpose: The main script that orchestrates the data collection, storage, and analysis processes.
	Contains the main() function, which is the entry point of the application.

•	requirements.txt:

	Purpose: Lists the Python packages and versions required for running the project.
	Includes dependencies like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, and pymongo.

File Interrelations:

main.py interacts with the following components:
•	ThingSpeak API: Used to fetch real-time sensor data.
•	MongoDB Database: Utilized for persistent storage of hydration data.
•	Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn: Used for data analysis and visualization.

Project Status:

The current implementation covers the following aspects:

•	Data fetching from ThingSpeak and remapping to descriptive column names.
•	Storing data in MongoDB for persistent storage.
•	Analyzing hydration data over time, including plotting and correlation analysis.
•	Displaying summary statistics and histograms for various measurements.

To be continued in the next trimester:

•	Further refinement of data analysis and visualization techniques.
•	Implementing additional features for more comprehensive insights.
1.	Real-time Visualization:

	Add a real-time dashboard to visualize hydration data dynamically as it is collected.
	Utilize libraries like Plotly or Dash for interactive and live plotting.



2.  Alerting Mechanism:

	Implement an alerting mechanism based on certain hydration thresholds.
	Send notifications or alerts when hydration levels fall below or exceed a predefined range.

3.  Machine Learning Models:

	Train machine learning models to predict hydration levels based on historical data.
	Integrate the trained model to provide predictive insights into future hydration levels.

4.	Data Filtering and Querying:

	Allow users to filter data based on specific criteria such as date ranges, activity levels, or other relevant parameters.
	Implement querying functionality to extract specific information from the MongoDB collection.

5.  User Authentication and Authorization:

	Introduce user authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data.
	Create user roles with different levels of access permissions.

•	Optimizing code for better performance and scalability.
